# Library-Management-System

The primary objective of the Library Management System project is to provide a user friendly interface that can perform the necessary functions of a library catalogue efficiently with low space and time complexity. 
User management plays an important role as maintaining  records of accounts and their activity is the foundation of the library. This is done using hashmaps to maintain data on users holding accounts in the system and further enables easy access to the former. The objective of providing a cost efficient database management is fulfilled here as hashmaps have a time complexity of O(1) compared to other data structures such as linked lists which have a time complexity of O(n). 
To enhance the user experience, it is necessary to ensure a interface that is easy to use and easy to navigate. This is done utilising the classes from the Java Swing. Other than just saving user info, the user is also provided with various functions such as borrow/return books, calculate fine, search books, etc. which makes it easy to utilise the library contents which would otherwise demand manual effort.
